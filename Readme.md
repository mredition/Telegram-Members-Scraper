Hello pals, this the telegram group member adder tool written in python.

How it works?

you have to get you api_id and api_hash from https://my.telegram.org here!

Basically it scrapes meber from group where the logined id is admin and it creates a .csv file.
And the adder reads .csv file and add member to the target group.

ther SendMessages tool send the setted messges to the members .csv file which are scraped!
